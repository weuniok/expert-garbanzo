## Education

### BEng Aerospace, Warsaw University of Technology
Thesis: "Use of Error Correction Codes to prevent errors resulting from Single Event Upset phenomena"

I learned how to design and engineer things, so that they are feasible and manufacturable, from the idea to existence.

It also taught me finishing projects on time by planning realistic deadlines and distributing workload across the week. Also, writing idiot-proof project documentation.

## Technical Skills
- Languages: TypeScript, Python, MATLAB, embedded C, 
- Frontend: React, React Native
- Backend: Node.js, Django
- Cloud: GCP
- Tools: Git, Docker
