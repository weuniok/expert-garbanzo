## Experience

### neenCare — since January 2024

Cofounded a startup to develop an infant life sign monitoring system, overseeing end-to-end product development from concept to MVP.

- Led mobile application development using React Native to deliver real-time monitoring capabilities to caregivers.
- Co-designed the physical sensor system, including embedded C programming and electronics, ensuring reliable data acquisition.
- Integrated the mobile app and sensor data with a cloud-based database, providing seamless data synchronization and remote access.
- Engaged in rapid prototyping, testing, and iterative improvements based on user feedback, ensuring an agile development process.
- Managed cross-functional tasks such as market research, fundraising, and user experience design to align the product with startup goals.

### Quickersim — since June 2022

- Developed and maintained three web applications for engineering simulations focused on statics and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Built with a React front-end, Django/Node back-end, MATLAB simulation engines, and Python-based microservices on GCP. 
- Built tools provided engineers with robust, scalable platforms for high-performance computational tasks, significantly reducing engineering time by streamlining design processes
- Optimized key artifact generation by a factor of 5, halved it's size and revamped the user experience flow 

### Warsaw University of Technology — from July 2023 to October 2023

Developing Infant Monitoring System for SIDS (Sudden Infant Death Syndrome) Prevention.
- Designing the measurement system 
- Mobile&Web App creation (React Native)
- Programming the system controller computer (Python)

### SAE AeroDesign — from July 2021 to April 2023

- Club's management as a board member
- Arranging public procurements through the University.
- Co-authored a research paper about 5G C-Band impact on aviation.
- Plane construction for SAE Aero Design competition.
- Co-authored 3 planes technical documentation (1st place, 2x4th place) and presented
- Presented our design in front of jury once (1st place)

### Airbus — from July 2021 to April 2023
As part of an internship made assembly manuals for airplane parts, basing on on computer designs and interviewing assembly workers.

### Joint Institute for Nuclear Research — from July 2021 to April 2023
I created a Python application that receives, archives and visually presents data transmitted by a cosmic ray CosmicWatch detector.
Main problems to solve: serial communication, data processing and visualisation, design and implementation of the graphical user interface.
I learnt about issues related to the source, propagation and detection of cosmic radiation and presented my project at the final seminar in English.

## Education

### BEng Aerospace, Warsaw University of Technology
Thesis: Use of Error Correction Codes to prevent errors resulting from Single Event Upset phenomena

I learned how to design and engineer things, so that they are feasible and manufacturable, from the idea to existance.

It also taught me finishing projects on time by planning realistic deadlines and distributing workload across the week. Also, writing idiot-proof project documentation.
